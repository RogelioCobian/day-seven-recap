<!-- Types Questions -->
<!--
Some examples of the different types in typescript are string,
number, boolean, any, and a class if you make one.

Undefined means you haven’t defined it or created it yet, or it isn’t available.
Null is a bit like zero where it technically exists, but it isn’t anything.

Types of array do exist, and with them you can define what an array has.
